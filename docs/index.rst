Pyjacket documentation
======================

Welcome to the Pyjacket documentation. Pyjacket is a collection of general-purpose utility functions.
It extends the base language with many useful features, such as obtaining the digits of a number, or locating the n'th occurence of a character in a string.

In addition, it provides an extra layer of utility around existing libraries, such as Numpy or Matplotlib.
For example, you can inspect the memory usage of a numpy array or override the default matplotlib styling into something more professional.

You can install Pyjacket using pip:

>>> pip install pyjacket
